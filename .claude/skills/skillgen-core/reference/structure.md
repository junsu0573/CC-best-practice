# Structure & progressive disclosure

## SKILL.md should contain only

- quick start
- workflow
- output contract
- guardrails
- one-level links to reference files

## One-level deep rule

- SKILL.md → reference/\*.md (OK)
- reference/\*.md → other reference files (avoid)

## Size guidance

- prefer < 300 lines in SKILL.md
- hard limit 500 lines (split into reference/\*)

## Reference files

- if > 100 lines, add a short TOC at top
